# README

Working through the Rails and HotWire Codex. Since this book is from 2022, some stuff has changed so I'll be doing some slight alterations to the code although I will aim to create the same finished product as shown in the book.


## Credit
Thanks to my friend Josh for showing me this book.

## Differences
A major difference between what I'm doing and what is in the book is that I'm using RSpec instead of Minitest. Development of this project may be slower due to using different testing tools.
